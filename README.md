# DATA STRUCTURES 101
This is my independent project for the course, CISC 4900, of the Brooklyn College computer science department. It is a simple website that allows users to educate themselves on the various qualities of commonly known data structures.
Each covered structure has its own page that contains concise and informative explanation of how it behaves, as well as its various advantages, disadvantages, and applications. Users will also be able to view graphs of the runtimes of the covered data structures when running basic functions.
Finally, users will be able to take a short quiz in order to test their knowledge of the data structures covered by the website. 

# USAGE
The site can be accessed at http://acc6.its.brooklyn.cuny.edu/~iruan/home.html from any desktop or laptop. Unfortuately, the site has not been configured to work on mobile devices.
