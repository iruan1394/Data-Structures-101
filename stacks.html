          <h1><b><u>What is a Stack?</u></b></h1>
          <br>
          <p>A stack is a container in which elements are added and removed in a particular order. This order is <b>LIFO</b>, or last in first out. The element that was last added to the stack
          is said to be at the top and will be the first to be removed. Conversely, the element that was first added to the stack is said to be at the bottom and will be the last to be removed. In order to uphold this 
          rule, a stack only allows for direct insertion and deletion at its top. Adding an element to the top of the stack is called <b>pushing</b> while removing the top element is called <b>popping</b>.
          </p>

            <div class = "caption">Stack perfoming push and pop</div>
          </div>
          <br>
          <p>A stack can be implemented using either an <a href = "arrays.html">array</a> or a <a href = "linkedlists.html">list</a> data structure. In the former case, the stack will have a limit to how many elements it can hold, but there will never be a situation where an element cannot be stored due to lack of memory space.
          In the latter case, the stack will resize itself as elements are pushed and popped. However, this can lead to issues with memory usage if the stack grows too big. It is up to the programmer to decide which implementaion suits their needs best.

          <br>
          <h4>• <b><u>Fast Top Insertion, Deletion, and Access</u></b></h4>
          <p class = "indented">Stacks excel at adding, removing, and looking at elements only at the top. These 3 functions will always have constant runtimes no matter how many elements are stored within the stack. This is true regardless of which data structure
          was used to implement the stack.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h4>• <b><u>Fast Reversal</u></b></h4>
          <p class = "indented">Because stacks follow the LIFO order, reversing the order of the elements within one is quite easy. Simply popping until the stack is empty will return the elements in the order of last added to first.

          <br>
          <h4>• <b><u>Cumbersome Insertion, Deletion, and Access Below the Top</u></b></h4>
          <p class = "indented">A stack does not allow for direct inserting, deleting, or accessing of elements at anywhere besides its top. If it is absolutely necessary to do so, elements must be popped out until the target position becomes the new "top" of the stack. Once the desired function has been performed, the removed elements must then be pushed back in. This process is extremely inefficient and slow, so it is highly recommended to use alternative data structures to perform such tasks.

          <h1><b><u>Stack Applications</u></b></h1>
          <br>
          <p>Stacks are great for applications where backtracking, or undoing the most recent action(s), is a desired function. They are also suitable to hold data that's meant to be reversed. Some examples of stack applications are: </p>
          <br>
          <ul>
            <li><u><b>Maze Solver</b></u>: In the process of solving a maze, a program will inevitably hit walls or dead ends. When such events occur, it is necessary to move back to a previous position or undo the most recent action. If the moves taken in the maze were stored in a stack, it would be quite simple to do so by popping the most recent ones. </li>
            <br>
            <li><u><b>Palindrome Test</b></u>: A palindrome is a sequence that reads the same even when reversed. For example, the word "racecar" is a palindrome because when reversed, it would still be read as "racecar". If we utilized a stack to store a sequence we wished to test, we can quickly get its reversed version to compare with the original. </li>
