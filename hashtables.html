          <h1><b><u>What is a Hash Table?</u></b></h1>
          <br>
          <p>A hash table is a very unique data structure. In a hash table, each element is made up of 2 things: a key and a value. A <b>key</b> is a unique identifier needed to access a corresponding <b>value</b>, a piece of stored data. 
          Values in a hash table are stored in indexed slots known as <b>buckets</b>. When a key-value pair is added to a hash table, the value needs to be assigned a bucket. This is done through the use of a 
          <b>hash function</b>. A hash function takes in a key and returns a number depending on what the key is. This number is known as a <b>hash value</b> and represents the bucket in which the key's corresponding value will be stored. The purpose of a hash function
          is to ensure that it is impossible to access any value within the hash table without knowing its key.
          </p>

            <div class = "caption">Hash Table containing names and phone numbers (Taken from Wikipedia)</div>
          </div>
          <br>
          <p>There are many different kinds of hash functions, especially since keys can be a variety of data types. However, a hash function should ideally have several properties: </p>
          <br>
          <ul>
            <li><u><b>Consistent</b></u>: The hash function should always return the same hash values for the same keys.</li>
            <br>
            <li><u><b>Hard to Reverse</b></u>: Given a hash value, it should be extremely difficult or near impossible to calculate the key that outputted it. The output of the hash function should not give any clues as to what the input was.
            This is to ensure that a value cannot be accessed using only the bucket number that its stored in.</li>
            <br>
            <li><u><b>Collision Resistant</b></u>: When the same hash value is computed from multiple distinct keys, the hash table will attempt to store multiple values in the same bucket. This is known as a <b>collision</b>. Good
            hash functions should ensure that collisions are unlikely to happen. It should also have measures in place to deal with collisions when they do occur. One method is to chain the values in the bucket through the use of a linked list.</li>
            <br>
            <div>
              <img class= "center" src = "images/hashtable2.png"></img>
              <div class = "caption">Hash Table chaining values in a bucket when a collision occurs (Wikipedia)</div>
            </div>
            <br>
            <li><u><b>Uniform Distribution</b></u>: Hash values should be assigned in an even spread-out manner. When similar keys are inputted into the hash function, the hash values computed should not be close to each other. This would make it easy for someone to guess the key needed to access a specific bucket if they knew the key for a bucket close to the target.
            It would also be likely for collisions to occur if hash values were generated in a concentrated range.</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <p>It has to be noted that the more of these properties that a hash function possesses, the more complicated it may become. Thus, ideal hash functions may take a lot longer to compute than
          unideal ones. In situations where speed is needed more than security, less effective hash functions may be more appropriate.</p>

          <h1><b><u>What are the Advantages of a Hash Table?</u></b></h1>
          <br>
          <h4>• <b><u>Efficient Searching</u></b></h4>
          <p class = "indented">In order to find a value within a hash table, the only thing that needs to be done is computing its key's hash value. As long as there were no collisions,
          it will always take the same amount of time to find any value within the table. As a result, hash tables are appropriate for holding large amounts of data with items that need to be searched for. 
          </p>
          <br>
          <h4>• <b><u>Efficient Insertion and Deletion</u></b></h4>
          <p class = "indented">Adding and removing entries in a hash table will also take the same amount of time regardless of the table's size. As long as no collisions are encountered, all that needs to be done is calculating the target's hash value and directly performing the insertion or deletion at the specified bucket. </p>
          <br>

          <h1><b><u>What are the Disadvantages of a Hash Table?</u></b></h1>
          <br>
          <h4>• <b><u>Degradation Due to Collisions</u></b></h4>
          <p class = "indented">As a hash table holds more and more data, the chances of a collision occurring increases. This is because while there could be infinite possibilities for keys, a hash table cannot have infinite buckets due to memory limitations. When collisions do occur, the speeds at which
          operations such as insertion and deletion are performed become inconsistent. Even an extremely effective hash function cannot prevent collisions if there are simply too many keys that need to be assigned a hash value. Ideally, the size of the data meant to be stored in the table should be known beforehand, so that 
          an appropriate hash function and table can be created.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h4>• <b><u>Ineffective for Small Data Sets</u></b></h4>
          <p class = "indented"> Even though hash tables are known for their speed, they can still be beaten by other data structures when the size of the data stored is small. This is because of the hash function. If the table is using an effective hash function,
          computing a single hash value can take a while, exceeding the time needed for alternative data structures to perform the desired task.  Therefore, when working with small amounts of data, hash tables may not be the most optimal means of storage.

          <h1><b><u>Hash Table Applications</u></b></h1>
          <br>
          <p>Hash Tables have many applications due to their fast searching capabilities. They are mainly used when working with large amounts of data that have unique identifiers. Some applications of a hash table are: </p>
          <br>
          <ul>
            <li><u><b>Employee Management System</b></u>:  In pretty much any company, a computer system is used to keep track of every employee's information such as name, position, and salary. When an employee's status within the company changes,
            he or she needs to be quickly located within the system so that their recorded information can be editted. When an employee is newly hired, their information needs to be quickly stored in the system.  A hash table would allow for such functionalities. The information of each employee would be stored as values within the table and their keys would be their ID number. </li>
            <br>
            <li><u><b>Electronic Dictionary</b></u>: When a user searches a word in a dictionary, they should be able to view its definition instantly no matter what the word was. Because of the sheer number of existing words in the English language, a hash table is 
            without a doubt the best option for this kind of application. After all, the time it takes to search for an element within a hash table is unaffected by the table's size. Words would be stored as keys while their definitions would be stored as values. </li>
            <br>
