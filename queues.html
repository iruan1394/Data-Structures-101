          <h1><b><u>What is a Queue?</u></b></h1>
          <br>
          <p>A queue is very similar to another data structure known as a <a href = "stacks.html">stack</a>. It is a container that only allows for the adding and removing of elements in a particular order. It may or may not have a size limit depending on implementation. However, unlike a stack, the order that queues follow is <b>FIFO</b>, first in first out. 
          The element that was first added to the queue is said to be at the front and will be the first to be removed. Conversely, the element that was last added is said to be at the back or rear and will be the last to be removed. In order to uphold this 
          rule, standard queues only allow for direct insertion at the back and direct deletion at the front. Adding an element to a queue is called <b>enqueuing</b> while removing one is called <b>dequeuing</b>. Queues also store the locations of front and back elements, allowing for direct accessing 
          to both.</p>

            <img class= "center" src = "images/queue1.png"></img>
            <div class = "caption">Queue perfoming enqueue and dequeue</div>
          </div>
          <br>
          <p>There is a special type of queue known as a <b>priority queue</b>. In this kind of queue, elements are given a value known as a priority. When an element is enqueued, its position within the queue would be based on the priority it was assigned. A low priority element would 
          be placed near the back of the queue, while a high priority one would be placed near the front. Consequently, when dequeue is performed, the element removed would be the one with the highest priority. In a situation where multiple elements have the highest priority, FIFO will be followed, and 
          dequeue will remove the one that was added the earliest. 
          </p>

          </div>
          <br>
          <p>Another special type of queue is the <b>deque</b>, a double ended queue. A deque is essentially a combination of a stack and a queue, allowing for insertion and deletions to be performed at the front and back. They are used when the both functionalities of a stack or standard queue are required.</p>

          <h1><b><u>What are the Advantages of a Queue?</u></b></h1>
          <br>
          <h4>• <b><u>Fast Accessing at Both Ends</u></b></h4>
          <p class = "indented">Since a queue always keeps track of the elements at its front and back, accessing them can be done quite quickly. Also, the size of the queue will not affect the speeds at these accesses are done.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h4>• <b><u>Fast Back Insertion and Front Deletion</u></b></h4>
          <p class = "indented">Enqueuing and dequeuing are simple processes that do not take much time. Like accessing at ends, back insertion and front deletion will always take the same amount of time regardless of the size of the queue.
          This advantage is expanded for deques, which allow for fast insertion and deletion at both ends.
          </p>

          <h1><b><u>What are the Disadvantages of a Queue?</u></b></h1>
          <br>
          <h4>• <b><u>Cumbersome Insertion, Deletion, and Access at Middle</u></b></h4>
          <p class = "indented"> Queues are not meant to perform operations in positions besides the front and back. If it is absolutely necessary to do so, elements must be removed from the front and inserted in the back until the target position becomes the front of the queue.
          After the desired function has been performed, more enqueuing and dequeuing needs to be done until the elements are in the original order. This process is extremely slow and inefficient. Thus, queues should not be used to perform 
          operations on anywhere except its ends.

          <h1><b><u>Queue Applications</u></b></h1>
          <br>
          <p>Queues should be used when data is processed in the FIFO order. Priority queues should be used when data members need to be given priorities and processed in the order of highest priority to lowest. Deques should 
          be used when the functionalities of both a stack and a queue are needed. Some examples of queue applications are:
          </p>
          <br>
          <ul>
            <li><u><b>Retail Order Management</b></u>: When an item is being sold by a store, the customers that order the item first should naturally receive it first. Thus, queues are an appropriate choice to handle the orders for items being sold by a vendor. If the store offers a VIP system where 
            members can receive their orders faster than non-members, a priority queue would be used. VIP members would be given higher priorities than non-members and serviced first.</li>
            <br>
            <li><u><b>Call Center Phone System</b></u>: A call center may find itself in a situation where too many people are calling at once, and there aren't enough employees to answer all of them. When this happens, the customers are put on hold until one is free. The customers that called first
            should obviously be answered first, so the callers put on hold would be stored in a queue. When an employee is able to take another call, the caller at the front of the queue would be removed and serviced.</li>
            <br>
            <li><u><b>Multiprocessor Task Scheduling</b></u>: In multiprocessor computer systems, when one processor has completed all of its tasks, it may be desirable for it to "steal" a task from a busy processor. Storing each processor's tasks in seperate deques would them to execute them in the order that they were assigned. At the same time,
            it would also allow a free processor to efficiently "steal" tasks from a busy one. This would be done by removing a task from the back of a busy processor's deque and inserting it into a free one's.</li>
